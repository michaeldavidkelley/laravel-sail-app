# laravel-sail-app


This repo builds the "app" container for laravel sail.  This is expecially useful if you're using a devcontainer with Laravel Sail's published assets.  

Using a container in this repository will reduce the time it takes to cold start Sail (docker compose up).  

I'm currently using these images to run Laravel Sail in Github Codespaces. This has cut Codespaces Prebuild times in half.

Create an issue if you have questions.
